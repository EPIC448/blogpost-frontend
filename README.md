**Project Title**
   BlogPost-Frontend


**Motivation**
   Honestly, The Science part of me fueled this project. As a natural born engineer, I wander what it would be like to add almost identical functionality of Twitter to a blog post, combined with the Upvote and Downvote function of Reddit or anyother apps out there.

    Simply put, what app do I wish I had when I use web application such as reddit or twitter.
    
     *That answer birth this project.* 
     

**Code_Sample**

   *fetch from the API*

```
    export function fetchBlogposts(){
    return (dispatch) => {
        fetch('http://localhost:3000/blog_posts')
            .then(resp => resp.json())
            .then(blog_posts => dispatch({
                type: 'FETCH_BLOGPOSTS',
                payload: blog_posts
                
            }))
            .catch(error => console.log(error) )
    }
  }

```

*React-redux implementation*

 ```
 import React from 'react'
import {connect} from 'react-redux'
import { addBlogpost } from '../actions/addBlogpost'

class BlogpostInput extends React.Component {

    state = {
        title: '',
        content: ''
    }

    handleChange = (event) => {
        
        this.setState({
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value,
        })
    }

    handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault()
        this.props.addBlogpost(this.state)
        this.setState({
            title: '',
            content: ''
        })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label>BlogPost Title: </label>
          <input type='text' placeholder='Title' value={this.state.title} name="title" onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
          <br></br>
                    <label>BlogPost Content:  </label>
          <input type='text' placeholder='Content' value={this.state.content} name="content" onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
          <br></br>
                    <input type="submit" />
        </form>
            </div>
            
        )
    }

}

export default connect(null,{addBlogpost})(BlogpostInput)
```
