 <!-- Requiments. -->

Requirements  React/ Redux Project.

. There should be 2 container components (Two Classes)

There should be 5 stateless components (components that are functions… There simple Render and display data)

√There should be 3 routes (Usually in the App Components./  Different form Rails Routers..And we are using React Routers. )

Redux  Must be use  in the front end.  (Use Redux Store  to keep track of all the important  data. )
√ Use redux Thunks.

Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch()   {Refering to the React/redux fetch} within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery method.



 Suggestion:
 Make a new Branch on the project when do the front … part. 

Write a Short Blog post for the project. Simple every time you work on the project. Take down notes of what passed and what didn’t and so on.

Front-End parts

Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!.. 

You Need to React-bootstrap if you are to use REACT BOOTSTRIP..  BUT it not madantory. you can use your own costumizered css. -->
